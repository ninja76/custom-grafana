###Grafana dashboard scripts

These are just a couple of Grafana scripts that I used to provide some links in from Sensu and Uchiwa. I was inspired by a post on this site: http://anatolijd.blogspot.com/ and I took his scripts and hacked together a few more dashboard options


### instance.js
takes a hostname and displays basic system metrics that are collected from the Sensu vmstats metric plugin

### cloudwath.js 
takes an RDS instance in and displays metrics imported from Cloudwatch to Graphite
